Field studies involve observing and analyzing users in their natural environment to gain insights into their behaviors, attitudes, and needs. Researchers may also conduct interviews, surveys, or other qualitative research methods to gather additional data. Field studies can be used to inform the design of new products or to evaluate the effectiveness of existing ones.

## When to use

Field studies are useful when designers or researchers want to gain a deep understanding of users' behaviors, attitudes, and needs in real-life contexts. They can be particularly helpful in identifying pain points, unmet needs, and other issues that may not be immediately apparent in laboratory or controlled settings.
