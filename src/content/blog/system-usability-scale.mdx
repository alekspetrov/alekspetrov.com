The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a standardized questionnaire designed to measure the perceived usability of a system, product, or service. The survey consists of 10 items, with each item rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree". SUS has been used extensively to evaluate the usability of various products and services, including software, websites, mobile applications, and medical devices.

## When to use

When to use: SUS is an effective method for evaluating the usability of a product or service once it has been developed and released to users. It can be used to compare the usability of different products or services, as well as to track changes in usability over time. SUS is often used in conjunction with other user research methods, such as usability testing or focus groups, to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the user experience.

    **Cons**

    - SUS is a self-report measure, and users may not always accurately report their perceptions of usability.
    - The Likert scale used in SUS can be somewhat limited in its ability to capture nuanced user feedback.
    - SUS does not provide detailed feedback on specific aspects of usability and should be used in conjunction with other user research methods for a more comprehensive evaluation.
