Focus groups are a qualitative research method in which a group of participants, typically 6-10 people, are gathered to discuss a particular topic or product. The group is moderated by a researcher who asks open-ended questions and encourages discussion among the participants.

## When to use

Focus groups are useful for generating insights and ideas at the early stages of a project or for gathering feedback on a particular product or service. They can be used to explore user attitudes, opinions, beliefs, and behaviors.
