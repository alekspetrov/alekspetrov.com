User interviews are a qualitative research method used to gather insights and opinions from individuals about a product or service. Interviews can be conducted in person, over the phone, or through video conferencing. They typically involve open-ended questions and can be structured or unstructured.

## When to use

User interviews are useful during the early stages of product development to gain an understanding of user needs, behaviors, and attitudes. They can also be used to test specific features or design concepts.

    and perspectives, allowing designers to understand their needs, wants, and

    been uncovered through other methods.
