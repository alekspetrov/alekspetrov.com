Heuristic Evaluation is a usability inspection method where evaluators review a product's user interface and assess its compliance with recognized usability principles or "heuristics". Evaluators examine the product and identify any issues related to user experience design, usability, and interaction. This method is usually performed by a group of evaluators who work independently and provide feedback on the product.

## When to use

Heuristic Evaluation can be used at different stages of product development, such as in the early stages of designing, to identify potential usability issues, and to refine a product design to improve its usability. It can also be used after a product is launched to evaluate its effectiveness and identify opportunities for improvement.

    **Cons**

    -   The results of a heuristic evaluation are subjective and dependent on the evaluators' expertise and experience.
    - The method may not identify all usability issues and may miss some user experience problems that are only apparent through user testing.
    - The feedback provided by evaluators may not be representative of actual users' experiences.
