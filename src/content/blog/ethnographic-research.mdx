Ethnographic research is a qualitative user research method that involves studying people in their natural environment to gain an understanding of their behavior, attitudes, and cultural norms. Researchers immerse themselves in the context of the users they are studying, observing and interviewing them to gain insights into their needs, motivations, and experiences. Ethnographic research can take the form of participant observation, interviews, surveys, and artifact analysis.

## When to use

Ethnographic research is useful when seeking a deep understanding of the user's context, including their behaviors, attitudes, and motivations. It can be used to identify unmet needs, pain points, and opportunities for innovation. Ethnographic research is particularly well-suited to studying complex, multi-faceted systems such as healthcare, education, or workplace environments.
