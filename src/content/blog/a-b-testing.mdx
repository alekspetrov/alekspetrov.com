A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a quantitative user research method that involves comparing two versions of a product, service, or feature to determine which one performs better in terms of user behavior and business metrics. A/B testing typically involves randomly assigning participants to one of two groups, with each group experiencing a different version of the product or feature. The data collected is then analyzed to determine which version performs better in terms of metrics such as click-through rates, conversion rates, and user satisfaction.

## When to use

A/B testing is best used when a specific change or feature needs to be tested to see how it performs in comparison to the current version. It can be used to test various aspects of a product, such as design elements, copy, user flows, pricing, and more. A/B testing can be used at various stages of the design and development process, from the initial concept phase to post-launch optimization.

    **Pros**

    -   A/B testing provides a clear, objective way to measure the effectiveness of design changes or new features.
    - It allows designers and product teams to make data-driven decisions based on real user behavior.
    - A/B testing can be relatively quick and inexpensive to set up and run.

    **Cons**

    - A/B testing requires a large enough sample size to be statistically significant, which can be challenging for smaller user bases.
    - It can be difficult to isolate the effect of a single variable when testing multiple variables at once.
    - A/B testing only provides insight into what users are doing, not necessarily why they are doing it. Additional research methods may be necessary to uncover deeper insights.
