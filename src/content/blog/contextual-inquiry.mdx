Contextual Inquiry is a generative, qualitative user research method that involves observing and interviewing users in their natural environment while they perform their tasks. This method aims to uncover user needs, behaviors, and attitudes by understanding how users interact with a product or service in their daily lives.

## When to use

Contextual Inquiry is best used in the early stages of the design process when exploring user needs and requirements. It is also useful when evaluating existing products or services and identifying areas for improvement.
