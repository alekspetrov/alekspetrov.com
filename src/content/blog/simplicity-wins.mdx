Do you ever feel like your solution isn't good enough because it's too simple? It's a common tendency to over-complicate things, but most often the simplest solution is the best one.

With the fast pace of the modern world, it's easy to get caught up in the stress of constant production. However, if you take a step back and look around, you'll see that simplicity usually wins in the end.

IT guys often think that something so simple couldn't possibly work, but that's not true, they just used to use complicated solutions.

Simple things, processes, programs, designs, and communication languages can actually make a company easier to manage and develop. According to the [TRIZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ/) theory, the ideal result is a situation where something performs its function but doesn't actually exist. This approach is great for startups and fast-moving teams.

Simple things are timeless and easy to learn. They donâ€™
t require much maintenance and are scalable.
