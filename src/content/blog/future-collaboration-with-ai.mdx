AI has taken a solid place in our lives and its development alarms many, but I am currently an AI advocate and believe that it can change our life for the better in the nearest future.

Our interaction with AI will be based on collaborative work, where humans are generators of ideas and AI is a generator of solutions (or answers). Before we used to write queries to Google, now we can get quite a specific answer from the AI to a question. It is much faster than browsing links, waiting for the page to load and scanning its content. We want to do the work faster and AI can help us get to the next level.

Such collaboration already works! I use GPT-3 when I'm writing blog articles and I can quickly clarify a term or make a fact check. Sometimes I need to reword a sentence to make it more understandable, or see if it makes sense in the text I put there. At this point, does the AI do my job? No, I don't think so, it helps me to convey my experience, but so that this experience is understood by the reader.

This kind of collaboration should be used in a new types of products, where the AI takes on the role of an assistant. Look how many developers highly appreciated Github's Co-Pilot which is AI based coding assistant. Co-Pilot is a faster way to find a solution than StackOverflow. Also you don't need to type all the code, tell what you need to implement and AI will write the code for you. Isn't that a dream?

AI will soon become an integral part of our lives, I am sure that this trend is for the best only and will significantly increase human performance in veriety of tasks.
