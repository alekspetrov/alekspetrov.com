Cognitive Walkthrough is a usability inspection method used to evaluate the usability of a product or system through the lens of the user's cognitive processes. This method involves a set of structured tasks and scenarios, where evaluators walk through the product or system to identify potential usability issues that may cause user errors or confusion. The goal is to identify possible barriers to effective interaction and to improve the user experience.

## When to use

Cognitive Walkthrough can be used in the early stages of product development, as well as during later stages of usability testing. This method is useful when trying to identify usability issues that may not be immediately apparent, such as when there is a mismatch between the user's mental model and the system's design.

    **Pros**
