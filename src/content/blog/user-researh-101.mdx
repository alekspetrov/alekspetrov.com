## What is user research?

User research plays a crucial role in the UX design process. It systematically studies user behavior, needs, and preferences to gain insights and inform design decisions. In other words, it helps UX designers and managers understand how people interact with products, services, or systems, as well as their expectations.

User research can take various forms, including qualitative and quantitative research methods, ethnographic studies, surveys, usability testing, and user interviews. The choice of method depends on the research question, the data required, and the available resources. However, regardless of the method used, user research should always aim to gain empathy and understanding of the user's perspective.

## Why is user research beneficial?

User research offers numerous benefits, primarily providing valuable insights into the user's needs, preferences, and pain points. These insights help designers and managers create more effective, user-friendly products and services.

For example, user research can help answer questions such as:

- What product or service features do users expect?
- What challenges do users face when using the product or service?
- What motivates users to use the product or service?
- What are the users' goals when using the product or service?

By answering these questions, designers, and managers can identify opportunities for improvement and develop design solutions that better meet the user's needs.

User research also minimizes risks and costs associated with the design process. By testing and validating design concepts with users early on, designers and managers can avoid costly mistakes and ensure their designs meet the user's needs. This approach minimizes the risk of developing a product or service that fails to meet user expectations, resulting in negative feedback and lost revenue.

Finally, user research provides a way to measure the effectiveness of design solutions. By conducting usability testing and other research methods, designers and managers can evaluate the user's experience and identify areas for improvement. This approach ensures design solutions meet the user's needs, resulting in increased satisfaction and better business outcomes.

## The guide to conducting effective user research

To conduct effective user research follow a clear process:

1. **Define your research objectives**. Aim for 3-7 objectives per project that align with your overall business goals. For example, to understand what people need to feel prepared for their flight, you could learn about their situations, goals or motivations, knowledge, decision-making process, and behaviors.

2. **Decide who you want to interview** and design an interview guide that helps you gather the necessary insights. For example, for air travel research, you might want to interview people who fly often, people who have flown 1-2 times only, people who took short vs. long international flights, and staff.

3. **Design an interview guide**. Structure your interviews with a wide general conversation that becomes more specific as you proceed. Use open-ended questions and ask for stories. Avoid opinions and do not talk about your ideas.

4. **Conduct the interviews**. Interviews typically last anywhere between 30 minutes and 1h30, depending on how much you can learn. Always anchor things by coming back to facts in your discussions, and take as many notes as possible. When interviews go bad, dig deeper or move on to lower-level experimentations.

Once you've collected your data, analyze it using a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods to gain a well-rounded view of your users' needs. This approach helps you identify patterns and trends that inform your product design.

Finally, reporting your findings is crucial to the success of your research. Present your insights clearly and concisely, tying them back to your original research objectives.

Remember, the way you structure your interview and the questions you ask can greatly influence the insights you gather. By following a structured approach like the one outlined in this guide, you can ensure that you are systematically and unbiasedly gathering information. This approach allows you to better understand the experiences and perspectives of your users and gain insights that can inform your product development decisions.

Good user research is a continuous process of learning and iteration, and the insights you gain from interviews should be validated through other research methods as well.

## Classifilaciton of User Research Methods

There are many different methods for conducting user research, but they can generally be classified into two main types: quantitative and qualitative research methods.

### Qualitative User Research Methods

Qualitative research is a method that involves collecting non-numerical data, such as user opinions, attitudes, and behaviors, through observations, interviews, focus groups, and other methods. Qualitative research aims to uncover deep insights into user needs, desires, and motivations, making it a useful tool for generating new ideas and understanding the user's context.

The most common qualitative research methods include:

- [[Contextual Inquiry]]
- [[Field Studies]]
- [[User Interviews]]
- [[Focus Groups]]
- [[Card Sorting]]
- [[Diary Studies]]
- [[Usability Testing]]
- [[Heuristic Evaluation]]
- [[Cognitive Walkthrough]]
- [[Ethnographic Research]]

### Quantitative User Research Methods:

Quantitative research is a method that relies on numerical data and statistical analysis to gain insights into user behavior and attitudes. This type of research is typically conducted through surveys, A/B testing, clickstream analysis, web analytics, system usability scale (SUS), net promoter score (NPS), customer satisfaction (CSAT), and key performance indicators (KPIs). Quantitative research aims to measure the frequency and magnitude of user behavior and attitudes, making it a useful tool for identifying patterns and trends.

The most common quantitative research methods include:

- [[Surveys]]
- [[A-B Testing]]
- [[Remote A-B Testing]]
- [[Tree Testing]]
- [[Clickstream Analysis]]
- [[Web Analytics]]
- [[System Usability Scale (SUS)]]
- [[Net Promoter Score (NPS)]]
- [[Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)]]
- [[Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)]]

Also research methods can be categorized into three main types: **generative**, **formative**, and **summative**.

### Generative research methods

Generative research methods are used to identify new opportunities and generate ideas. They are exploratory, aiming to uncover new insights and understand the user's needs, desires, and behaviors.

### Formative Research Methods

Formative research methods are used to refine and improve **existing ideas**. They are evaluative, aiming to test and refine design concepts before launch.

### Summative Research Methods

Summative research is a method used to evaluate a product's usability with representative users and tasks, designed to measure the complete product's usability.

Summative evaluations can be either quantitative or qualitative studies. Summative usability evaluation is typically done after a design is complete to understand what is usable and what is working. There are five main methods of conducting summative research, including online evaluations, surveys, interviews, focus groups, and experiments.

## Conclusion

In social research science, conducting interviews is a commonly used methodology for gathering data and insights from study participants. Interviews can be conducted in person, over the phone, or online, and can range from structured questionnaires to open-ended conversations. The advantage of conducting interviews is that it allows researchers to gather rich and in-depth information on a particular topic or issue. However, conducting interviews also requires careful planning and preparation, as well as the ability to ask probing questions and listen actively to the participant's responses.

Ethical considerations, such as obtaining informed consent and protecting the privacy and confidentiality of the participant's information, must also be taken into account. Overall, user research and social research science share common challenges and requirements for conducting effective and ethical research that meets the needs of participants and researchers alike.
