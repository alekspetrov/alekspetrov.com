Web analytics is a quantitative research method used to collect, measure, and analyze data related to website traffic and user behavior. It involves the use of tools such as Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, and other software that collect data on website visitors, such as the number of visitors, how long they spend on the website, what pages they visit, and what actions they take.

## When to use

Web analytics is useful when trying to understand how users interact with a website, what pages are most popular, and what elements need improvement. It can help identify issues with website usability and provide insights into user behavior patterns. It is typically used during the design and development phase of a website or as a continuous improvement tool.
