Surveys involve collecting data from a large number of participants using a structured set of questions, usually administered through an online form, email, or phone. Surveys can be used to gather information about user preferences, attitudes, behaviors, and demographics, as well as to measure user satisfaction, usability, and other user experience metrics.

## When to use

Surveys are useful when you want to collect data from a large and diverse group of users quickly and efficiently. They can be used in the early stages of product development to gather user feedback and insights, as well as in the later stages to measure the success of a product or service. Surveys can also be used to compare the performance of different products or to evaluate the effectiveness of design solutions.

    **Cons**

    - Limited depth: Surveys provide a high-level view of user behavior and preferences, but lack the depth and nuance of other research methods like interviews or contextual inquiry.
    - Response bias: Surveys can be subject to response bias, as users may not always provide truthful or accurate answers.
    - Lack of context: Surveys provide data in isolation from users' real-world experiences and contexts, which may limit the insights gained from the research.
