Card sorting is a method used to understand how people categorize and organize information. Participants are given a set of cards, each containing a piece of content or information, and asked to group them in a way that makes sense to them. This method helps to inform the information architecture of a product or website, ensuring that content is organized in a way that makes sense to users.

## When to use

Card sorting is typically used in the early stages of design or redesign when developing the information architecture of a product or website. It can be particularly useful when designing navigation menus, site maps, or organizing large amounts of content.
