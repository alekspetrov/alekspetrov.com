Wordy is a tool based on a proven methodology to learn information pieces fast and non-destructive.

It stores data pieces inside collections and helps you to learn information in a modern and non-destructive way.

## Collections

Use a browser extension or minimalistic UI to save terms into collections that are filterable and sortable databases.

Share them with others or even groups of users by sending a link or providing access inside the application.

## Methodology

There is an amazing methodology behind Wordy it was invented by memory expert [Hermann Ebbinghaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus) and is used in many educational programs around the world because it works.

Ebbinghaus's research dates back to the 1880s, but it is still widely used and highly regarded. In 2015, a research team successfully reproduced his findings and concluded that his methods and theories still held true.

Wordy extends this methodology with learning tools, providing the system to store, share and control terms in collections.

Wordy made as a teaching program, we crafted only the best and tested solutions. Use "Cards" or "Writing" features to repeat and use new terms. Learn to pronounce words and sentences from other languages.

**Cards** — available

Use keyboard navigation to go through a collection word by word and mark terms you feel OK with. Don't worry, you will repeat them soon.

**Repeats** — available

Check out the Methodology section below to find out how it works. Repeats send you notifications to repeat some words you marked "to remember". Intervals of notification are very important to follow. If you don't Wordy push it to the previous level of repets. This means the better you learn the less you need to repeat.

**Write** — an upcoming feature

Wordy goes further and wanted you to start using your words to learn them even better. This AI-based methodology is unique. AI gives you a text based on the collection you need to repeat, then it asks you to write couple sentences and check them. If the mark is good, you are good, if not this collection will be marked to repeat.

**Watch** — an upcoming feature

Watch shorts generated by AI to find out more about the term context.

Context is very important in a variety of terms and words, learn them.

## Schedules

Control your notifications and comfortable time during a day to learn, Wordy respects your privacy and not gonna push you at night till you ask.

## Control your memory capacity

You can select how much information you need to keep in mind on a regular basis and what is less important but still needs to be in mind. Wordy helps to prevent information overload and remember what is really important.
