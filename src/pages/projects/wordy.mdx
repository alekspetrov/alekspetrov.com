The idea came to me when I was looking for extension to collect words I want to remember to improve my vocab in english. Found some free ways of doing collections + translations but they all was awful and useless.

I started with small extension to save terms to the cloud data base, but then I remembered one methodology from the most experiences in human memory expert Hermann Ebbinghaus.

Ebbinghaus investigated human memory to find out how the learning mechanics work in our brain. He was pretty productive and his researches used worldwide to create learning products including school and universities programs.

Here you can see that we need to repeat information to remember it, and first week is very important. So the only thing needed is to set list into collections and run notification to repeat information. The best way to learn is flipping card, but I don’t need to flip something just show translation or terminology and use shortcuts to decrease time loss.

### Market research

I decided investigate into market and it was not a surprize that there are 2-3 projects who can help me with my problem. But all of them did't find the idea what to do next. Used one them to see the result and learned nothing for a week. But get tons of spam emails. I don’t like the design and feel they have for application people should open every day. I can make it calm, simple, easy to use and... "sexy!", thanks Elon have a seat.

Market research shows that there are a lot of potential here, traffic is stable and pretty high. Applications downloads impressive and they have stable audience but I didn’t find communities except Facebook pages but this is not the best way to get a feedback. Seems like existing solutions are blind to user problems. It is not difficult to grab some audience from them.

I checked pricing for all or them. And they all pricy for the service they have. I can make it cheaper using appropriate technologies available on market today.

### MVP Cost

I summed up how much I need to spend for the MVP version and I was surprised that I need nothing! Supabase gives more then I need to start this project, and scale it in case it makes some profit in the future.

Supabase uses AWS to store data and media

### Plan

I spent the first week for investigation and setup technologies. Here is my regular workflow.

- Idea
- Research
- Unit-economy
- Roadmap
- Heavy tasks investigation
- Correct roadmap to exclude heavy but low priority tasks
- MVP
- Research
- Updates

The idea grew fast from simple application to the marketplace for creators of collections. This is amazing, I really enjoy helping people, it motivates me.

Now Wordy is on finish line to become alpha. Landing page comming soon. Also Looking for a place to register new company to get money and pay taxes. In case you interested in collaborations or work together, then let me know at [hello@alekspetrov.com](mailto:hello@alekspetrov.com?subject="Wordy").

### Conclusions

I got huge amount of experience during the process. This is the best way to improve product manager's skills and make something usefull. This project gave a clear vision of the roadmap from the idea to lunch through design process and testing.

Idea is nothing without experience, but experience is impossible without ideas.
