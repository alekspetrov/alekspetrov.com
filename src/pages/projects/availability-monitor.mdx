### Objective

Customer wanted to see availability status in realtime for API endpoints, websites, internal IPs.

### Research and design

After research among future users and stakeholders we fund that people wanted to see a dashboard to know if their projects (endpoints, websites etc.) have issues with availability.

{/* Image of the research results */}

I designed a dashboard using simple and scalable design inspired by data centers full of blinking lights.

Filtes

{/* server_images */}

Stop button stops the endpoint service. This button is available only for websites and some services and exists because of the business specific.

{/* show the schema how red button works */}

### Development

{/* Show the plan */}

Using "Fail Fast" and "HADI" methodoligies for product development we got insights for improvements and future updates.

Frontend part based on Vue.js, WebSockets and JSON API which was pre-discussed with the a backend team. Final plan was short and clear, for async work I used a local JSON server mocking data from the server.

### Stack

This stack consists of JS developers who are easy to find nowdays and there are many full-stack dev who can maintain this project. Main focus was made on DX, security and performance.

### Results

The application became in demand within the company and help product managers, admins, dev ops, incident managers and marketing department specialists to see in real time what is happening with the services and react faster.
