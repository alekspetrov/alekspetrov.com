Ebbinghaus’s research dates back to the 1880s, but in 2015, a research team successfully reproduced his findings and concluded that his methods and theories still held true.

<ContentTerm
  term="Cards"
  deff="Imagine your collection as a slider where each slide is your information slice. You can see the term, but not its definition. Now play a knockout game and mark terms as known or not. The next cycle will show you only unknown terms."
/>

<ContentTerm
  term="Repeats"
  deff="As you noticed from the schema above people gradually forget everything they have learned with time. And the only way to keep information in mind is to refresh it. Repeats help to get notifications and stay on the learning curve used cycles."
/>

<ContentTerm
  term="Write"
  deff="Based on Artificial intelligence. Write a short essay using terms users learned to learn them even better. AI will check if you use them right in the right context and gives you a score.
