### Objective

Client wanted to see availability status in realtime for API endpoints, websites, internal IPs.

### Success metrics

Together with a customer we next metrics of the project. (Do not switch with product metrics!)

- Deliver at least 80% of ideas from the MVP's backlog;
- Release application on time and budget;

### Research and design

After research among future users and stakeholders I fund that mostly people wanted to open some instrument in the browser when needed and see if their projects has issues with availability.

{/* Image of the research results */}

I designed a dashboard with simple, universal and scalable design inspired by data centers full of blinking lights on the servers shells. Configurable filters help you make your own view.

{/* server_images */}

Stop button stops the endpoint service. This button is available only for websites and some services and exists because of the business specific.

{/* show the schema how red button works */}

### Development

Frontend part based on WebSockets and JSON structure we pre-discussed with the client's backend team in remote format. Final plan was short and clear.

{/* Show the plan */}

Using "Fail Fast" and "HADI" methodoligies for product development I found some points to improve and some to left for the future updates.

Selected tasks added on the roadmap to the beta version.

### Stack

Customer's stack mostly based on JavaScript architecture.

Frontend application:

- Vue 3
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- WebSockets

Backend service

- Node.js
- Hapi
- TypeScript
- WebSockets

This stack consists of JS developers they easy to find and there are many full-stack dev who can maintain this project. Used modern, easy to use frameworks having excellent DX ratings.

### Results

The application became in demand within the company and help product managers, admins, dev ops, incident managers and marketing department specialists to see in real time what is happening with the services and react faster.

### Insights

Looking for some product insights after lunch and find out that loading peak on the application is on release rolling out and friday second part of the day =) which is expected and funny at the same time.

### Reflections

It is so inspiring when your application used by people to do some job in a better way.
