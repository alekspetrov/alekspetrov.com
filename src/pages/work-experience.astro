      <p>
        I create a unique vision of digital products and lead teams to translate
        ideas into reality. Excel at taking startups through extensive user
        research, interactive prototypes, MVPs and clear roadmap. Enjoy
        discussing new technologies with developers and new trends with
        designers. I can act as a bridge between business, customers and
        engineers or designers using communications skills and deep
        understanding their pain points.
