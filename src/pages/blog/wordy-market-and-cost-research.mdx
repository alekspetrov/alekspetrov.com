This research made for [Wordy](/projects/wordy)
Here is my thougts and colclusions around the research.

The main goal was to understend the market and it's volume. Find similar or close by features applications and anslize them and their solutions.

There are only few projects have the common features. They looks good, works mosly well but they evaluating wrond direction. They do not polishing learning instruments but their pricing pages.

I used most of them for 1 month on regular basis learn nothing because they do not motivate and not work with you, they just boring tools.

Market research showed that there are huge potential to grow, traffic is stable and pretty high. Applications downloads impressive and they have stable audience.

I checked pricing for all or them. And they all pricy for the service they have. I can make it cheaper using appropriate technologies available on market today.
