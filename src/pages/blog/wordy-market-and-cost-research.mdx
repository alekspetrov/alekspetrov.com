This research was made for Wordy to understand the market and its volume. The second goal was Competitive Analysis to find out the market fit.

## Competitive Analysis

There are only a few projects that have common features. They look good and work mostly well but they evaluate the wrong direction. They do not polish learning instruments but their pricing pages.

I used most of them for 1 month on regular basis to learn nothing because they do not motivate and do not work with you, they are just boring tools.
Market research showed that there is huge potential to grow, and traffic is stable and pretty high. Applications downloads are impressive and they have a stable audience.

I checked the pricing for all of them. And they are all pricy for the service they have. I can make it cheaper using appropriate technologies available on market today.

## Cost of MVP
To calculate Minimum Viable Product cost I need only count new domain name registration because Supabase gives me enough space to start up.

## Workflow
Idea
Research
Unit-economy
Roadmap
Heavy tasks investigation
Correct roadmap to exclude heavy but low-priority tasks
MVP

Updates

Wordy is on the finish line to becoming alpha. Landing page coming soon. Also Looking for a place to register a new company to get money and pay taxes. In case you are interested in collaborations or working together, then let me know at hello@alekspetrov.com.

## Conclusions

I got huge experience during the process. Making is the best way to grow as a product manager.
Complete the full way from idea to the first dollar is so inspiring for me.
