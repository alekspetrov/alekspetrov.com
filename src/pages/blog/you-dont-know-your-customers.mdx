People are complicated and don't rely not only on their logic in their behavior. Human's motivation mainly comes from emotions that person have now or had before. We are emotional and sensitive to the context, and it makes us individuals.

Product Managers can't even hope that the customers will repeat an action which they have done many times before. There are many contextual factors that affect buyers every moment of their lives, and unfortunately they are mostly destructive.

Everyone is different by many parameters and life history, cultural and social experiences etc. There are no two identical human on the planet and we have to stay unique to survive. Difference is a part of our nature.

Now tell me that you know how your customers behave, because you know them.

### How to progress?

Use Data Driven approach for decision making process. Check all available metrics regularly, look on the heat map and user sessions, speak to your customers and collect results. Do not relay too much on A/B tests.

Being a Product Manager means leaving your ego behind. Do not build a product for yourself but for owners and customers.
