Does it better to write here in .md document with a preview on the website, or in my notion and then take them back by API... why I need Notion? I mean I can use just GitHub to edit markdown and even add components. If I don't need notion, maybe I don't need supabase to store my content? Or I can populate it on the build step right from the Astro functions.

## What actually I afraid

Not to have simple and useful architecture? Bullshit, this is because I want to build something more complex, but actually I don't need it.
