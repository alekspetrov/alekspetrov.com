How often do you feel that your solution is not good enough because its simplicity? Maybe you don't even need a single line of code. I see a tendency to complicate everything, people don't have time to think, they're under constant stress.

But look around, simplicity wins.

IT guys usually think that because it's so simple, it won't work. On the contrary, simple things, processes, programs, design and communication languages add to the company remove unnecessary restrictions and make the product, company, team, etc. easier to manage and develop.

According to the [TRIZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ) theory the ideal result is a kind of situation when something performs its function but doesn't exist. This approach is great for startups and fast moving teams.

Simple things are timeless and easy to learn.
