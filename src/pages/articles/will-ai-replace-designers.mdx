Photoshop didn't kill designers. And neither will the AI.

With the advent of the computer and Photoshop, many graphics designers at the time assumed there was a threat to their profession and that it could disappear. People said that computers were killing creativity, but in the end, the opposite happened. With the arrival of Photoshop, there are a lot more designers, and the profession has found new forms of expression.

Today I see a lot of reports that AI will replace designers and programmers in the near future. I find this idea unlikely because AI is a tool but not the designer himself. AI will produce different results for different inputs. This means designers are still needed and they continue compete with each other. Design tools will be replaced by more advanced ones, there is nothing wrong with that for the profession.

AI itself cannot replace a designer (yet), because it needs to get an input from a human or a system that humans created. The result of such "creativity" will be the processing of input data. Do not overestimate such solutions, those who have worked with them know that they are limited in their capabilities and often give unpredictable results.

A real designer executes his vision, not a program, a vision he has felt and accepted as a solution. This is a much more complex task than generating images based on input. I am very curious to explore the possibilities of AI and already see options for use in a whole range of products.

Also designer is not only make art, he also communicates, accept paymenets, inspiring surroundings and much more. And when we will create somthing like this, we create a new kind of human. AI is a great tool and should be treated as a tool, but sometimes philosophical discussions in the chat with the AI raise questions even for a skeptic persons.
