AI has taken a firm place in our lives and its development alarms many, but I am currently an AI advocate and believe that it can change our lives for the better and significantly simplify them.

Our future interaction with AI will be based on collaborative work, where humans are generators of ideas and AI is a generator of solutions (or answers). Before we used to write queries to Google, now we can get quite a specific answer from the AI to a question. It is much faster than browsing links, waiting for the page to load and scrutinizing its content. We want to do the work faster and AI can help us get to the next level and it's happening now.

For example, I use GPT-3 when I'm writing blog articles and I can quickly clarify a term or make a fact check. Sometimes I need to reword a sentence to make it more understandable, or see if it makes sense in the text I put there. At this point, does the AI do the work for me? No, I don't think so, it helps me to convey my experience, but so that this experience is understood by the reader.

I think this kind of interaction should be used in a new kind of product, where the AI takes on the role of an assistant and helps with different tasks. Developers have been quick to appreciate the beauty of Github Co-Pilot, because it's faster to find a solution than StackOverflow.

Working with AI will soon become an integral part of our lives, I am sure that this trend is for the best and will significantly reduce the human workload, which in today's world is already more than enough.
