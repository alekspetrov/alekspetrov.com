### Motivation

I started this book when I was looking at job openings and became frustrated with the descriptions and responsibility sections. Most entrepreneurs are looking for project managers but don't want to say it loud (I'm not sure why, they cost less).

This book should help to address the situation.

### About me

I have experience in managing projects on different life cycle stages. I've had roles on both sides as a product manager and developer, designer, or product owner. Now I can tell exactly what a product manager is and who is not, what their responsibilities are, limitations, tools, pain points, and fears.

### Contribution
