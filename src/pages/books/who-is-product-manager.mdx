### Motivation

The idea came to me when I was scrolling through the jobs board to find out what companies are looking for when they publish Product Managers positions.

I was frustrated with the descriptions and responsibility sections even in large companies. Most of them look for Project Managers to control a team and move tickets in JIRA.

But a good Product Manager can help businesses make more money, find a new vision of the product, and convince developers to take care of users sounds better than moving tickets?

This book is for HR and CEO specialists who want to unlock the power of Product Managers in the company and for Product Manager who wants to compare their experience and improve it.

For many years I've managed projects on different life cycles. I've had a lot of roles: product manager, developer, product designer, and product owner, marketer. Now I know exactly who the product manager is, what his place in the company is, and what others awaiting from him. I will show his responsibilities, limitations, pain points, and fears.
