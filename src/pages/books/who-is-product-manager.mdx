### Motivation

I started this book when I was looking at job openings and became frustrated with the descriptions and responsibility sections. Most entrepreneurs are looking for project managers but don't want to say it loud (I'm not sure why, they cost less).

This book should help clear up the situation.

### About me

I have experience in managing projects on different life cycle stages. I've had roles on both sides as a product manager and developer, designer, or product owner. Now I can tell exactly who is a product manager is and who is not, what the responsibilities are, limitations, tools, pain points, and fears.

### Contribution

This book will be written in open format. You can become a co-author!
